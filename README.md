#Cad $ Converter

This is a chrome extension is used as an extension to Yahoo Finance. It will automatically convert the prices of USD listed stocks to CAD. This plugin can be used only on Yahoo Finance, by clicking on any US exchange listed stock. When you select any stock the prices of the DOW, S&P500 and the NASDAQ will be converted as well as the stocks information that would be value to know the CAD dollar equivalent. The factors changed include the current price of the stock, the daily change in value, and some of the additional information for the stock. You can tell that a price has been changed by seeing the appended “CAD” onto any of the prices. To complete the conversion, the current price of the CAD dollar is used directly from the top of yahoo finance. The backbone of this extension is the regular expressions that I’ve created to determine if the content it’s looking at matches that of a currency. 
This extension also comes with a simple popup that can be used to turn on and off the extension. This will save the state of the extension to your account, meaning that it will save your preference from computer to computer. However, you need to be signed into your google account.
